# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
perform analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview of Project


Louise, an up and coming playwright, would like to launch a U.S. crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever". This will be Louise's first campaign and will have an estimated budget of $10,000-$12,000. She has requested an analysis of crowdfunding data to determine if there were specific factors that contributed to the success or failure of prior campaigns. 


### Purpose

Determine viability of crowdfunding campaign for the play, Fever, with the overall goal of providing a roadmap which mirrors prior successful campaigns.


## Analysis and Challenges

The information provided covers a period of nine years with data relating to 4,100+ campaigns that spans 13 different countries. Additionally, there are nine campaign categories which can be further broken down into 40+ subcategories.

Given the vastness of the data it was important to isolate only that which is applicable to the requested analysis. There was the extra needed step(s) of scrubbing the data to ensure certain data are presented in a consumable format (i.e. dates, etc.), debugging, and manipulation of said data for production of visuals that communicated the data story.

There was a minor issue of scope creep as Louise also requested analysis on a handful of plays from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and musicals in Great Britain for a potential future project. Both requests were unrelated to the overall analysis. 

-Only theater/play compaigns in the US in the $10-14K range


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date


Line charts are helpful when trying to determine trends. We can see by looking at our new chart that the months of May and June both have a greater success rate.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?


 how much money people people be asked to contribute?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?




- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
